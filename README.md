## Senior Full-Stack Developer Freelance

Senior Full-Stack Developer in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, I've been helping startups and large companies design their web applications for 8 years.

## WorkoutGen — Co-founder

Alongside this, I co-created **WorkoutGen**, the AI web application that replicates the logic of an expert coach. 24-month programs, cycle-based progression, and an AI coach that adapts your sessions in real time. The Machine Learning engine learns from feedback to continuously improve.

#### Our Mission

Make gym-based weight training accessible to everyone by reinventing program generation through AI, combining training science with real feedback.

#### The Product

**Algorithmic Engine + ML** that learns from user feedback, custom physiological calculations, no generic generation.

**Intelligent Planning:** progression cycles, loads and rest periods calculated like an expert coach. 4 goals (muscle building, weight loss, strength, fitness), 500+ HD videos filmed by us, flexible scheduling.

**Features:** TikTok-style video player, training organization and schedule management, multi-platform PWA, gamification, 8 languages, one-click installation.

**Pricing:** Free with no ads, premium AI Coach option for real-time adaptation.

Co-created with **Jeremy Tellier** (BPJEPS certified, former Paris firefighter), combining field expertise with technical rigor.
