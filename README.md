Senior Full-Stack Developer in the JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystem, I've been helping startups and enterprise clients for **8 years** in designing their web applications.

## Co-founder of WorkoutGen

On the side, I co-founded **WorkoutGen**, a freemium fitness app powered by AI.

**Our mission:** Make gym-based strength training accessible to everyone. Not just another free tool we're reinventing workout program generation through AI, combining training science with real user feedback.

### The Product

- **Algorithmic engine + ML** that learns from user feedback not a ChatGPT wrapper, but a genuine physiological calculation system built from scratch
- **Planning of progression cycles**, loads, and rest periods like an expert coach
- **4 goals** (bulking, cutting, strength, general fitness), 500+ HD videos, flexible scheduling
- **Multi-platform PWA**, gamification, 8 languages, one-click install without an App Store
- **100% free with no ads**, monetized through premium AI Coach (real-time adaptation)

Co-created with **Jeremy Tellier** (certified fitness instructor, former Paris firefighter), combining field expertise with technical rigor.
